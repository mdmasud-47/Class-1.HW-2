        <h1> Messi and his journey with Argentina: The road to Glory</h1>
        <img src="./img.webp" width="70%">
        <p>Born in the city of Rosario, Lionel Messi's fight began from the very start of his football career. Fighting his way through a growth hormone deficiency from a young age to reaching the pinnacle of football with Barcelona, he is always involved in conversations involving the best player to have ever played the sport.</p>
        <h3> Copa America 2007</h3>
        <p>The string of disappointments started in 2007 where a young Lionel Messi saw his team lose 3-0 to a strong Brazil side as Julio Baptista, an Roberto Ayala own goal and Dani Alves snatched the title away from Argentina and extended its wait for a national title.</p>
        <h3>World Cup 2014</h3>
        <p>This was Argentina's golden period under manager Alejandro Sabella. Spearheaded by Messi, Argentina had the chance to lift the World Cup title on Brazilian soil. But Germany broke Argentine hearts yet again as Mario Gotze's 113th minute goal was enough for Germany to win the World Cup.</p>

        <h3>Copa America 2015</h3>
        <p>The next heartbreak came in 2015 as Argentina and Chile played out a 0-0 draw and the match went to penalties. Argentina lost that shootout and what made it even more bitter for Messi was the fact that he could not convert his spot-kick. Gonzalo Higuain and Ever Banega also missed their respective penalties</p>

        <h3>Copa America 2016</h3>
        <p>Argentina faced Chile again in 2016 at the Copa America Centenario final staged in the United States of America. The match was tied after extra time once again, which forced a penalty shootout. As fate would have it, Messi would go on to miss his penalty and Chile was crowned champion for the second consecutive year.
            <br>
            Messi announced his international retirement after that defeat, only to reverse the decision some months later.</p>

            <h3> Copa America 2021</h3>
            <p>Lionel Messi shocked the world when he announced his retirment from international football in 2016 after missing a penalty in the Copa America final against Chile which saw Argentina lose a fourth major final in nine years, but he quickly returned to the national setup. Five years later and it was redemption for Messi. He expressed his happiness after enduring a prolonged series of near misses.

                But Argentina put that right on Saturday at the Maracana Stadium thanks to Angel Di Maria's lob in the first half which steered them <a href="https://www.eurosport.com/football/copa-america/2021/argentina-1-0-brazil-lionel-messi-wins-major-international-trophy-as-angel-di-maria-fires-nation-to-_sto8413720/story.shtml" target="_blank"> to a 1-0 win over fierce rivals and tournament hosts Brazil.</a>

                Messi struggled to contain his emotions after the game on a historic night for Argentine football.

            <h3>Finalissma Argentina vs Italy</h3>
            <p>Lionel Messi stole the show as Copa America holders Argentina powered to a 3-0 win against European champions Italy in the Finalissima at Wembley on Wednesday. Inspired by the peerless Messi, Argentina raced into a two-goal lead in the first half of the prestigious friendly thanks to strikes from Lautaro Martinez and Angel Di Maria. Paulo Dybala capped Argentina's rout, but after a disappointing season with Paris Saint-Germain by his sky-high standards, it was the sight of Messi back to his imperious best that took the spotlight.

                The 34-year-old's eye-catching display featured two assists and was worthy of his rare appearance at one of football's great cathedrals.
                <br>
                <br>
                Thrown into the air by his jubilant team-mates after the final whistle, Messi said: "Today was a nice test because Italy are a great team. We knew it was going to be a nice game and a nice setting in which to be champions.
                <br>
                <br>
                "It was a beautiful final, full of Argentines. What we experienced here was beautiful."

        <h3>Fifa World Cup Qatar 2022</h3>
        <p>Lionel Messi’s journey to winning the 2022 World Cup has all the makings of an epic blockbuster. 
            <br>
            <br>

            The Argentine magician, widely regarded as the greatest player of all time by many, finally got his hands on the Jules Rimet trophy in Qatar after years of heartbreak. 
            <br>
            <br>
            Indeed, despite being a seven-time Ballon d’Or recipient, four-time Champions League winner and a 10-time La Liga champion – the World Cup was something that had always eluded the forward. 
        <br>
    <br>
    And so it seemed again after Argentina lost their first game of the 2022 World Cup against Saudi Arabia – one of the biggest upsets in the tournament’s history. 
    <br>
    <br>

Yet, despite many counting him out and assuming he was no longer the Messi of old, the 35-year-old silenced his doubters and at last emulated the great Diego Maradona. 
<br>
<br>

It was a fairytale story for both Messi and Argentina and it’s no doubt a World Cup that many will look back on as one of the greatest ever. 
<br>
<br>

And while there will inevitably be books, films and documentaries about Messi’s remarkable rollercoaster in Qatar.
